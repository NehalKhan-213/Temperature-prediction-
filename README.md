# Temperature-prediction-
This project is centered on developing a predictive model for estimating temperature values from humidity data using modern data science and machine learning techniques.
#Evaporation
Evaporation occurs when more water molecules escape into vapor than return to liquid. Each gram of water evaporated absorbs about 590 cal of heat from the surface. Since vapor pressure increases with temperature, evaporation continues until the air is saturated. The absolute humidity is the mass of water vapor per cubic meter of air, while the saturation humidity is the maximum moisture air can hold at a given temperature, which rises with temperature.
