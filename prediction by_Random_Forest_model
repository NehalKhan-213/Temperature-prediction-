prediction by Random Forest model 
big improvement. Let’s compare side by side:

#Linear Regression
MAE = 3.87 → Avg. error ≈ 3.9°C
MSE = 144.08
RMSE = 12.00°C
R² = 0.26 → Only 26% of variance explained

#Random Forest Regression
MAE = 2.16 → Avg. error ≈ 2.2°C (much lower )
MSE = 16.90 (almost 9× smaller )
RMSE = 4.11°C (errors reduced by ~8°C )
R² = 0.91 → Explains 91% of variance (vs 26%)

Conclusion:
Random Forest is far better for your dataset. It predicts temperature much more accurately from humidity than Linear Regression.
Linear Regression = too simple (only straight-line fit).
Random Forest = captures nonlinear patterns → gives high accuracy.

#Stick with Random Forest as your model.
